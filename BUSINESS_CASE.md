# Business Case: Implementation of OR Staff Planner AI

## 1. Executive Summary

The **OR Staff Planner AI** is not just a digital roster; it is a **revenue-protection and efficiency engine**. 

Currently, operating room (OR) management relies on static planning (Excel/Whiteboard) that cannot dynamically react to daily volatilities like sick leave, operation cancellations, or duration overruns. This results in **unnecessary room closures**, **overtime costs**, and **revenue loss**.

This system introduces algorithmic intelligence to OR staffing, ensuring that highly qualified staff are allocated where they generate the most value, while ensuring patient safety through strict qualification checks.

## 2. The Problem: The Cost of Inefficiency

Operating Rooms are the financial heart of the hospital (generating ~60-70% of revenue), but also the most expensive resource (~2.000€ - 3.000€ per hour).

1.  **Revenue Loss via Closures:** If a staff member calls in sick at 7:00 AM, entire rooms are often closed unnecessarily because manual rescheduling is too complex to solve instantly.
2.  **Turnover Times:** mismatched staffing (e.g., URO staff in a Trauma room) leads to longer changeover times, reducing the number of cases per day.
3.  **Staff Burnout:** Uneven distribution of workload and "Expert" responsibility leads to high fluctuation rates among OTA/Nursing staff.
4.  **Compliance Risk:** Manual planning often overlooks specific qualification requirements (e.g., Radiation Protection, Da Vinci Certification), creating liability risks.

## 3. The Solution: Intelligent Resource Management

The **OR Staff Planner AI** addresses these issues with three core engines:

### A. The "Revenue-First" Rescheduling Engine
When a room must be closed or an operation moved, the AI doesn't just look for "a free slot". It calculates:
*   **Financial Impact:** It identifies High-Revenue procedures (e.g., TEPs, Spine) and prioritizes them over elective minor interventions.
*   **Cluster Efficiency:** It actively suggests moving operations to rooms performing the *same department's* procedures. This reduces cleaning/setup time, potentially squeezing in **one extra operation per day**.
*   **Exact Duration Matching:** It reads estimated "Schnitt-Naht" times to find perfect fits, rather than blocking whole 4-hour slots.

### B. The Safety Validator
The system makes it mathematically impossible to plan unsafe rooms.
*   **Real-time Skill Check:** It alerts immediately if a room lacks an "Expert" for the specific procedure scheduled.
*   **Rule Enforcement:** "1 Lead + 1 Springer" rules are enforced automatically.

### C. The Workload Balancer
*   **Burnout Analytics:** The dashboard tracks exactly how many days staff have worked in high-stress roles versus "Springer" roles, allowing for fair rotation.
*   **Sick Leave Prediction:** It highlights days where the hospital is approaching critical staffing levels weeks in advance.

## 4. ROI Calculation (Return on Investment)

### Scenario: Preventing 1 Room Closure / Week
*   Average revenue per OR day: **~15.000€**
*   Cost of tool implementation: *Marginal IT maintenance*

If the AI's "Smart Rescheduling" finds a solution to keep a room open (or redistribute high-value cases) just **once a month**, the system pays for itself immediately.

### Scenario: Efficiency Gain
*   **Cluster Bonus:** Saving 15 mins of cleaning/setup time per room change by grouping same-department surgeries.
*   Across 8 rooms, this can release **2 hours of OR time daily**, allowing for 1-2 additional short cases daily.

## 5. Strategic Advantages

1.  **Data-Driven Decisions:** The "Executive Report" feature gives management a clear view of staffing bottlenecks ("We need 1 more URO Expert") backed by hard data, not gut feeling.
2.  **Attractiveness as Employer:** Modern, digital tools reduce frustration for OR managers and staff, showing that the hospital values their time and organizational health.
3.  **Future Proofing:** The system is ready to integrate with real-time tracking (Status 6/7) and HL7 interfaces in the future.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Moving from analog/Excel planning to **OR Staff Planner AI** is a shift from **reactive administration** to **proactive management**. It protects the hospital's core revenue stream while simultaneously increasing patient safety and staff satisfaction.

**Recommendation:** Immediate pilot phase in the Central OR (ZOP).
